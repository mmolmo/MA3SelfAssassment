		<h2>How I Got Here</h2>
		<p>I applied to UCF in the summer of 2019 as a high school senior after looking through many extensive college options. I first applied to Valencia College and then to UCF. When I got an email back from UCF, I accepted the decision as I liked the overall environment, campus, and other features. I chose to apply for the current major as web design is something I would like to get into and something that I feel is still going to be accessible even in the upcoming years.</p>

		<p>I attended a virtual orientation, took and finished general education classes at the main campus and started on some lower-level digital courses.</p>

		<h2>Year 2</h2>
		<p>For year 2, I took and learned more content about low-level and mid-level digital courses. I was able to gain some more knowledge in the field and refine some experiences with the software.</p>
