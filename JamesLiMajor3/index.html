		<p>
		  In the summer of 2019, as a senior, I, like many others, was focused on applying to universities and getting into a decent school. 
		  After looking through numerous college options on the internet, I came across UCF's website. One look through the site, and I was sold on the overall environment, social scene, and the wide range of majors offered. 
		  So, I applied for the digital media major, as I felt comfortable with web design due to my prior experience with coding and photo editing.
          When I received an acceptance email from the admissions office, I was extremely excited.

		  <p>
			The first year was relatively light. In the spring, I mostly took general education classes at the main campus that were unrelated to my major, such as English, math, and art history. 
			The classes themselves were alright. The main attraction was that I had the opportunity to meet some peers and attend club meetings on the main campus. 
			Learning more about the social scene was a pleasant experience, and I am proud to have made more connections and experienced some of the campus life. 
			In the summer, I completed most of those general education classes and also discovered my interest in humanities. Towards the end of the year, I started taking some lower-level digital media courses, where I was excited to learn basic information about the internet and Photoshop.

		<h2 id="secondyear">Year 2</h2>
		  <p>
			This is my second year at the university, and I am proud of the progress I have made in my digital media courses. 
			Last semester, I took low-level and mid-level digital media courses, which covered the basics of subjects such as photo editing software. 
			I gained more knowledge in the field and refined my experience with the software. Despite the challenges I faced in the course, I learned a lot during the semester. 
			Video creation and intro to design were probably my favorite courses, as I enjoyed working with the software.
			This semester, I had the pleasure of taking more courses that covered the content of algorithms, storytelling, and finally, this course, which focuses on the coding side of web design.

		  <p>
			I have greatly enjoyed studying in all of these courses, and they have enriched my view of the world. However, I realize that I still have much to learn. 
			As I move forward in my education at UCF, I plan to continue learning and growing in the field of web design, both inside and outside of school.
			Starting this summer, I intend to pursue independent projects related to my proposed field of study, UI design, by designing a mock website using the skills I have learned both in this course and others. 
			I am eager to complete more courses in this field of study and gain additional knowledge. I look forward to taking on more challenging projects and gaining more experience in the field, whether through internships or other related opportunities.

		<h1>Conclusion</h1>
		<p>In conclusion, I want to thank you for taking the time to read about my journey at UCF and my aspirations for the future. 
			It has been an incredible experience studying here, and I am grateful for all the knowledge and skills that I have gained. 
			I am excited to continue exploring the world of web design and UI, and I hope to create digital experiences that positively impact the lives of others.
			Thank you for your interest in my website and my journey. I hope that it has provided you with some valuable insights, and I look forward to sharing more of my work with you in the future.
